Dear Editor,

     I realize that Darcie-bashing is a regular fixture of your letters page, but this time she has really excelled herself. Can she please make up her mind if Red River is "dried up ... as empty as George W.'s promises" ["One Night on Red River," Music, Nov. 5, 2004] or if it is "rich [and] alive" ["99 Bands," Music, July 8]?

     Not only were her "reviews" slapdash and clich√©, many of the bands she listed had simultaneous sets. From this I am forced to conclude, her weird use of doublespeak notwithstanding, she either posseses the power of teleportation or didn't really take the time to watch more than 30 seconds of each band.

     We have come to expect this level of hackery from national publications, but from a paper that prides itself on being part of the solution this kind of fluff not only fails to give credit to the bands in Austin that deserve it most, her article ends up looking like an archived gig list, albeit without the venue addresses. Once again, Darcie Stevens proves that the Austin music scene thrives in spite of the Chronicle and not because of it.
